  {
    "description": "Abstract is an EVM compatible ZK-Rollup that is built on top of the ZK stack. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Abstract team",
    "name": "Abstract",
  },
  {
    "description": "Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup. The protocol team centrally operates the sequencer. Fraud proofs are enabled for whitelisted validators. The network also supports WASM-based contracts (MultiVM).",
    "name": "Arbitrum One",
  },
  {
    "description": "Base is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing the OP Stack technology. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Base team.",
    "name": "Base",
  },
  {
    "description": "Blast is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing the OP Stack technology. It provides native yield for ETH and stablecoins.",
    "name": "Blast",
  },
  {
    "description": "Ink is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing OP Stack technology. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Ink team.",
    "name": "Ink",
  },
  {
    "description": "Kakarot is a ZK-Rollup composed of an EVM written in Cairo and an RPC layer to allow users to interact with it in an Ethereum format. The EVM is a set of Cairo smart contracts deployed on a StarknetOS chain. At the moment, the rollup uses a trusted and centralised sequencer operated by the core team. Development is currently frozen!",
    "name": "Kakarot",
  },
  {
    "description": "Linea is a ZK-Rollup that targets EVM compatibility. As itâ€™s a product of ConsenSys, it is positioned to potentially benefit from better utilisation of the ecosystem's tools and infrastructure.",
    "name": "Linea",
  },
  {
    "description": "Optimism is an Optimistic Rollup boasting near full equivalence to Ethereum. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Optimism team. The way the protocol is structured and maintained makes it easy for external teams to reuse the technology and create/deploy their own rollups.",
    "name": "Optimism",
  },
  {
    "description": "Polygon zkEVM is a leading ZK-Rollup that targets bytecode-level compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. At the moment, the rollup uses a trusted and centralised sequencer operated by the core team. Cryptographic proofs are used to ensure the validity of state transitions within the rollup.",
    "name": "Polygon zkEVM",
  },
  {
    "description": "Scroll is a ZK-Rollup that targets bytecode-level compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the protocol team. The zkEVM circuits are based on Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Group research work on ZK-EVMs.",
    "name": "Scroll",
  },
  {
    "description": "Soneium is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing OP Stack technology. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the Soneium team.",
    "name": "Soneium",
  },
  {
    "description": "Taiko aims to be a Based and Type1 equivalent Rollup. It uses tiered multi-proofs system. At present, most Taiko blocks rely on SGX proofs, while the remainder use SP1 and RISC0 proofs. The zkEVM circuits are higher tier proofs not yet enabled in production.",
    "name": "Taiko",
  },
  {
    "description": "World Chain is an Optimistic Rollup utilizing OP Stack technology and made for humans, where the transactions of unique humans have priority and where they also have a free allowance, just for being a World ID verified unique human using proof of personhood. The protocol features a centralised sequencer operated by the World Chain team.",
    "name": "World Chain",
  },
  {
    "description": "Zircuit is an EVM-compatible zero-knowledge rollup with a unique hybrid architecture that combines the OP stack infrastructure with zero-knowledge proofs",
    "name": "Zircuit",
  },
  {
    "description": "ZKsync Era is a ZK-Rollup that targets EVM compatibility in its zk-friendly custom virtual machine. It provides standard JSON RPC API and preserves key EVM features such as smart contract composability while introducing some new concepts such as native account abstraction.",
    "name": "ZKsync Era",
  },
